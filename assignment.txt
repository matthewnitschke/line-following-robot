TangoBot - PiCam - follow a line.
Using a TangoBot and a PiCam attached to the Raspberry Pi you will write a program that will allow the robot to follow a road made out of yellow construction paper.........and eventually, the road will turn to bread crumbs which you will also need to follow until the road continues. 

Eventually, the road will dead end and you will need to have the robot stop. 

Road - Bread Crumbs - Road

Like the picture shown below....coming soon. 

Demos of your robot performing will be done on 13th, 14th and 15th. Times will be posted.
